// if obstacle is detected
    // stop tracking lines
    // default go left around obstacle if sensed straight ahead

    // once the righth echo sensor doesnt sense
        // try moving right until the right sensor senses 
        // keep checking for line in here 
            // once line is found on any sensor, then go back to line mode ?
