// controlling motor

// functions for turning left and right
// doesnt handle logic, turns slightly left or right
    // can be called a bunch of times in another function


// Note: variables for matching the bigger wheel and smaller wheels rotation
    // maybe we have some global variables that hold the equivalent speeds and 
    // for the rest of the code, we just make sure to work with decreasing and 
    // increasing speed by multiplying those variables
